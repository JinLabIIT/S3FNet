total_timeline 1	# total timeline (i.e. logical process) in the model.
tick_per_second 6	# tick is the simulation time unit. E.g., 6 means one second has 10^6 ticks (i.e. the time unit is microsecond). O means the time unit is second.
run_time 100		# simulation run-time in second. Actually it is the run-time of one epoch, and the system run one epoch in default.
seed 0			# seed for random number generator (a non-negative integer number). Simulation results are repeatable for the same seed.
